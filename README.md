## 📂 About JDBC

Before JDBC, ODBC API was the database API to connect and execute the query with the database. But ODBC API uses ODBC driver that is written in C language (i.e. platform dependent and unsecured). That is why Java has defined its own API (JDBC API) that uses JDBC drivers (written in Java language).
